    <h3>1. Mickey Mouse</h3>

    <p>
      Created in the 1920s, Mickey Mouse is a cartoon character that 
      also serves as the endearing mascot of the Walt Disney Company.
       Mickey Mouse is the world’s most notable fictional character, 
       with his famous red shorts, white gloves, and huge yellow shoes. 
       In the film Steamboat Willie,
      Minnie Mouse appeared alongside Mickey as his love interest.

    <h3>2. Genie of Aladdin</h3>
    <img src="/Genie_480x480.jpg" alt="Aladin" style="width:280px; height:280px; margin-left:70px;">
    <p>Yep, you’ve never had a friend like Aladdin’s Genie. 
      Despite his outrageously funny antics, this fast-talking blue
       fellow has a heart of gold, treating Aladdin more like a friend 
       than a master. 

      Genie is not just a magical being who can grant your wish,
       he’s also the ultimate icon of selflessness, 
       even after Aladdin freed him from Jafar. 
       He’s a massive element in every childhood and something that 
       reminds us of one of Robin Williams’ most-loved performances 
       in movies.

    <h3>3. Donald Duck
    </h3>
    <img src="/Donald-Duck_480x480.jpg" alt="Donald" style="width:280px; height:280px; margin-left:30px;">
    <p>Another recognizable Disney character is Donald Duck. 
      Together with Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, and the rest of the gang,
      Donald goes off on different adventures wearing his
      recognizable sailor shirt, cap, and bow tie. Donald is a fiery
      anthropomorphic duck who always falls victim to bad luck, 
      but we love him, anyway. 
      And so does Daisy Duck.  </p>
